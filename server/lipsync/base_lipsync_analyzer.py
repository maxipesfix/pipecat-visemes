"""Base class for lipsync analyzers.

A lipsync analyzer turns raw TTS audio into an articulation signal
(:class:`~lipsync.types.LipsyncKeyframe` and
:class:`~lipsync.types.LipsyncEvent`).
:class:`~lipsync.lipsync_processor.LipsyncProcessor` owns
buffering, timing and batching; analyzers only measure. The formant analyzer
is the only implementation and the design of record; the interface exists so
measurement stays separable from delivery (a stub analyzer is enough to test
the processor) and any alternative would leave the wire format unchanged.
